### This is a prototype of the binary decoding subroutine I am writing to interpret the map data ###

#Set an intial value
#(This will eventually be taken from the map contents memory)
+++++++

#decode the first binary bit and slide the remainder back into the input
[-
>> +
-[+<+>[-]] +
<[->->+<<]
<]

#slide the remainder
>>>[-<<<+>>>]<<<


#decode the second bit
[-
>>> +
-[+<<+>>[-]] +
<<[->>->+<<<]
<]

#I think this is pretty straight forward, but catch me tomorrow when I am looking over this flabbergasted
