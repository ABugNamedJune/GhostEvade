### BUILD PLAYFIELD MEMORY ###
Each tile in the playfield consists of three bytes
(0)  ABSOLUTE VALUE
(1)  GRAPHICS MEMORY
(2)  OBJECTS CONTAINED

#Set a pointer at memory cell 0 so we can find our way home later
#Set the size of the playfield (in this case 100)
++++++++++[->++++++++++<]-
>-
#Set n minus 1 in each playfield tile reservation for the absolute value
[[->+>+<<]>>-]

#Set ending pointer for Map memory
>>>->-<


### POPULATE MAP WITH OBJECTS ###
Each object is encoded into the Tile OBJECTS memory as a binary value
100 WALLS
010 GHOST
 PLAYER

### DECODE OBJECTS AND RENDER MAP ###
